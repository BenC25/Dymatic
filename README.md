Dymatic is a basic open source game engine created using C++.

Currently, Microsoft Visual Studio required, and only officially supports V2019.
The dyamtic.sln file allows access to all project, engine and external vendor code.




To clone source, have github installed to your computer and clone the repository.
Run the Win-GenProjects.bat file under the scripts folder to generate all content. 
Currently you will need to compile the solution yourself, open the soltuion file with
MCVS2019, change the settings to your platform, and debug settings. Then build and 
run the solution file.

Your newly generated engine build will be located under:

bin/{plaform, debug type}/{project name}/{project name}.exe

Enjoy using dymatic.





Where To Get Help

Anyone can get help on our documentation page, GitHub wiki, forums or on GitHub.
Just label as #help and anyone in the community can respond. Make sure that your question 
is descriptive and include screenshot and log information where necessary.

How You Can Help

Feel free to respond to anyone online and make changes to code and share them. 
If you have any recommendations or bug fixes needed, share them. Any code that you think 
should be a part of the engine mark with #intergration. When suggesting code avoid having too 
many changes in one document and upload them separately as one change that we do not like, 
will mean that the whole commit will be turned down.
